# SQL-App-ratings 

A project where i explore and derive insights from a table of app ratings on Apple store. Because I used sqlonlinelite, i had to break the description tables 
into multiple files before combining them back.

Some of the Insights I found are:
1. Paid apps have a higher average rating, 
2. Apps supporting between 10-30 languages have the best ratings, language is probably not the main focus of what makes a good app
3. Finance and book apps have the lowest ratings, could be a potential entry point to solve an unmet need  
4. Apps with comprehensive descriptions has better ratings
5. Aim for a hgiher rating than the average 3.5 rating
6. Games and entertainment genre have many apps, saturated and potentially difficult to compete
